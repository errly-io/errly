-- Production seed data for Errly
-- This file contains minimal essential data for production deployment
-- Only add data that is absolutely necessary for the application to function

-- Note: In production, spaces and users should be created through the application UI
-- This file is intentionally minimal to avoid accidentally seeding test data in production

-- Example of essential configuration data (uncomment if needed):
-- INSERT INTO system_config (key, value) VALUES
--     ('app_version', '1.0.0'),
--     ('maintenance_mode', 'false')
-- ON CONFLICT (key) DO UPDATE SET value = EXCLUDED.value;
